# Hotel-Booking-System-and-Employee-Life
This program simulates a Hotel Booking System, and you're an employee (Handling Room Reservations, Customer Data, and Payment Process). Also you can roam around in the hotel (Go to the pool, Restaurant, Break Room, and Game Room). Once you get out of work, the program simulates real-world interactions until you make it home (Such as getting gas, getting food, going to the arcade, or going to the gym. When you get home, the program will either ask to continue the current day, go to sleep and start the next day, or exit the program.

The program contains:
OOP, GUI, and other Frameworks/Libraries

Currently still working on the project

Game Room will have actual, real games I created
